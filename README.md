**The project was created as a part of completing the additional classes "Machine Learning" at the University of Warsaw.**

## Introduction
It contains the Titanic dataset analysis from Kaggle and the implementation of several machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Linear Regression, XGBoost to predict who survived.

## Content
There are two files in the repository:
+ Titanic-project
+ Titanic-project-less-features.

They contain a very similar code. The only difference is the use of different numbers of prediction features.
