# Machine_Learning_Basics

The project was created by me as part of completing the additional classes "Machine Learning" at the University of Warsaw. 

It contains the Titanic dataset analysis from Kaggle and the implementation of several machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Linear Regression, XGBoost to predict who survived.

There are two files in the repository:
* Titanic-project
* Titanic-project-less-features.

They contain a very similar code. The only difference is the use of different numbers of prediction features.
